# ElderCrank

**"Old enough to know better, still stubborn enough to do it right."**

Welcome to the ElderCrank workshop. I build Python libraries that are boring, 
predictable, and strictly typed. No fluff, no "magic" magic, just code that 
works and stays out of your way.

## The ElderCrank Philosophy
* **No-Nonsense Namespacing:** Everything lives under the `eldercrank` namespace.
* **Modern Plumbing:** Built for Python 3.13+ using `uv` and `hatchling`.
* **Zero Patience for Flaky APIs:** If it's in here, it's been vetted.
